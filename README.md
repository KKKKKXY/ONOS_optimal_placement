**The delay between Switch and Controller:**

d(s-to-c) = 4 \* (the sum of all switch-to-controller delays along the forwarding path)

dsc=4i=1ndsi-csi

dsc           The total delay from all switches to his own master controller
i               The ith switch along forwarding path
n              The number of switch along forwarding path
dsi-csi    The delay from ith switch to his own master controller
si             The ith switch
csi           The master controller of si

**The delay between Controller and Atomix:**

If the source and destination switch are managed by the **same** controller

- If all switches are managed by the same controller
  - d(c-to-a) = [2 \* (the sum of delays between the master controller to all Atomix nodes)] / the number of Atomix nodes

dca=2i=1, j=1n,mdcsi-ajm

- d(c-to-a) = [(2 \* (the sum of delays between the master controller of the source switch to all Atomix nodes)) + (the sum of delays between the master controller of each middle switch to all Atomix nodes) + (the sum of delays between the master controller of the destination switch to all Atomix nodes)] / the number of Atomix nodes

dca=2j=1mdcss-aj+i=2, j=1n-2,mdcsi-aj+j=1mdcsd-ajm

If the source and destination switch are managed by the **different** controller

- d(c-to-a) = [(2 \* (the sum of delays between the master controller of the source switch to all Atomix nodes)) + (the sum of delays between the master controller of each middle switch to all Atomix nodes) + 2 \* (the sum of delays between the master controller of the destination switch to all Atomix nodes)] / the number of Atomix nodes

dca=2j=1mdcss-aj+i=2, j=1n-2,mdcsi-aj+2j=1mdcsd-ajm

dca          The total delay from master controllers of all switches along forwarding path to all Atomix nodes
i               The ith switch along forwarding path

j               The jth Atomix node
n              The number of switch along forwarding path
m             The number of Atomix node
dcss-aj    The delay from master controller of source switch to jth Atomix node
dcsi-aj    The delay from master controller of ith switch  to jth Atomix node
dcsd-aj    The delay from master controller of destination switch to jth Atomix node
si             The ith switch
csi           The master controller of si

**

**The delay between Atomix and Atomix:**

d(a-to-a) = [(2 \* (the sum of the **minimum** delay between each Atomix node to the other all Atomix nodes))] / the number of Atomix nodes

daa=2j=1mmin‚Å°(daj-aj')m

daa                        The total delay within Atomix nodes

j                              The jth Atomix node

j'                            The other all Atomix nodes except jth Atomix
m                           The number of Atomix node
mindaj-aj'   The minimum delay from jth Atomix node to other all Atomix nodes
